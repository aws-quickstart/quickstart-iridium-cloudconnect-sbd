This Quick Start is for Iridium users wanting the following:

* To receive Short Burst Data (SBD) status messages from Iridium devices in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

* To have the message queues reside on their own AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance.

* To set up Iridium CloudConnect with cross-account authentication to transfer SBD messages through a secure and redundant connection with AWS.

This guide contains the instructions for deploying the Iridium CloudConnect for SBD on AWS Quick Start.

NOTE: Short Burst Data messages referred to here include mobile-originated (MO) and mobile-terminated (MT) messages sent to and from Iridium-based devices. See the Iridium Short Burst Data Developers Guide for more information about SBD message specifications.
