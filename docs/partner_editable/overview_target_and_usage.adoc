This Quick Start will benefit an Iridium customer wanting to receive Short Burst Data (SBD) data from Iridium-based devices in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Message queues are stored on the Iridium customer's own AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment. This guide contains the instructions to deploy the Quick Start to set up Iridium CloudConnect with cross-account authentication and a secure and redundant connection between the Iridium SBD gateway and AWS.

NOTE: Short Burst Data messages referred to here include mobile-originated (MO) and mobile-terminated (MT) messages sent to and from Iridium-based devices. See the Iridium Short Burst Data Developers Guide for more information about SBD message specifications.

//TODO: Link to developer's guide?
