This Quick Start reference deployment guide contains step-by-step instructions for deploying the Iridium CloudConnect for SBD on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for Iridium users that want to:

* Deploy Iridium CloudConnect into an existing AWS architecture to transfer mobile-originated (MO) and mobile-terminated (MT) Short Burst Data (SBD) messages through a secure and redundant connection with their own virtual private cloud (VPC).

* Send, store, and receive SBD messages in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format with a highly available Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) messaging queue service.
