This Quick Start reference deployment guide contains step-by-step instructions for deploying the Iridium CloudConnect for SBD on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for Iridium users that want to:

* Deploy Iridium CloudConnect into an existing AWS architecture to transfer mobile-originated (MO) and mobile-terminated (MT) Short Burst Data (SBD) messages through a secure and redundant connection to and from the AWS Cloud.

* Send, store, and receive SBD messages in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format in highly available Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) messaging queue service.

* Have message queues reside on their own Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) instance.
