Iridium CloudConnect is a satellite cloud-based adapter service that transfers SBD messages from Iridium-based devices to the AWS Cloud. 

Using this Quick Start, you can launch Iridium CloudConnect for SBD into your existing AWS workload. This Quick Start uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) to send, store, and receive Iridium SBD messages with a choice of standard and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues that are highly available and scalable.

For more information about Iridium SBD message specifications, see the Iridium Short Burst Data Developers Guide.
