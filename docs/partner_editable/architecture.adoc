As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly-available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), deployed into your existing virtual private cloud (VPC), to provide a highly available queueing service for your Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) messages transferred by Iridium CloudConnect.

*Deployed in a single, highly-available AWS Region with redundant Availability Zones. With this architecture, no single computer, network, or Availability Zone failure can render your Iridium SBD messages inaccessible.
