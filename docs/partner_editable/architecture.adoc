As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly-available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), deployed into your existing Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture, storing Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) message queues and messages.
* Cross-account permissions for Iridium CloudConnect to access SBD queues managed by Amazon SQS. 

*Deployed in a single, highly-available AWS Region with redundant Availability Zones. With this architecture, no single computer, network, or Availability Zone failure can render your Iridium SBD messages inaccessible.
